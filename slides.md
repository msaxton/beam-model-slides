## BEAM Model for Research Based Writing


### How do we think about and use sources for research based writing?


### The traditional model
* Primary sources
* Secondary sources
* Reference (tertiary) sources


### Limitations of the traditional model
* Rigid in classification
* Conflates genre and function
* Ignores the rhetorical function that sources play in a scholarly argument


### BEAM Model
* Background
* Exhibit
* Argument
* Method (or Theory)

## Background
* **Background sources** are used for uncontested information or common knowledge .
* These sources set the context of the scholarly conversation.

## Exhibit
* **Exhibit sources** are used as evidence or examples for explication, analysis, or interpretation.
* These sources are often the topic of the scholarly conversation.

## Argument
* **Argument sources** are used as claims to affirm, refute, refine, or extend.
* These sources are your conversation partners.

## Method (or Theory)
* **Method sources** are used for their methodological or theoretical approach to a topic.
* These sources lay the ground rules for a scholarly conversation.
