### The traditional model
* Primary sources
* Secondary sources
* Reference (tertiary) sources


### Limitations of the traditional model
* Conflates genre and function
* Ignores the rhetorical function that sources play in a scholarly argument


### BEAM Model
* Background
* Exhibit
* Argument
* Method (or Theory)

## Background
* **Background sources** are used for uncontested information or common knowledge 
* These sources set the context of the scholarly conversation.

## Exhibit
* **Exhibit sources** are used as evidence or examples for explication, analysis, or interpretation.
* These sources are often the topic of the scholarly conversation.

## Argument
* **Argument sources** are used as claims to affirm, refute, refine, or extend.
* These sources are your conversation partners.

## Method (or Theory)
* **Method sources** are used for their methodological or theoretical approach to a topic.
* These sources lay the ground rules for a scholarly conversation


### Brief Example
* Freedgood, Elaine. *The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel.* Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006 (pp. 5-6).

<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left">"And my choice of objects is influenced by structures of thoughts and feeling that derives from a line of critical thinking that could be traced from Marxist cultural studies, the study of culture and imperialism, postcolonial theory, and studies of power and subjectivity from Franz Fanon and Sigmund Freud to Michel Foucault and Judith Butler. The result is the method of the first three chapters of this book: one in which the historically and theoretically overdetermined material characteristics of objects are sought out beyond the immediate context in which they appear. These objects are then returned to their novelistic homes [Jane Eyre, Mary Barton, Great Expectations, Middlemarch], so that they can inhabit them with a radiance or resonance of meaning they have not possessed or not legitimately possessed in previous literary-critical reading."</p>

### Extended Example
* In small groups, review the selected article.
* Find sources used by the author(s) and identify their use: background, exhibit, argument, or method (theory)


### Advantages of the BEAM model
* Emphasis on the *use* of a source
* Useful as a framework for *reading*
* Useful framework for *writing*
